# Kirby Logic Field

*Version 1.1 [Changelog](docs/changelog.md)*

Inject your logic into a custom field.

**[Installation instructions](docs/install.md)**

## Usage

### Blueprint

Set the `type` to `logic`:

```yaml
fields:
  my_logic_field:
    title: My logic field
    type: logic
```

### Code

In `config.php` (or a plugin):

```php
c::set('plugin.logic.field', function($field) {
  return '<p>' . $field->name() . ' ' . $field->page->title() . '</p>';
});
```

If you don't like inline html you can replace it with a [snippet](https://getkirby.com/docs/templates/snippets).
