# Kirby Logic Field

*Version 1.0.0*

Add a custom field without building it.

**[Installation instructions](docs/install.md)**

## Usage

### Blueprint

Use the type logic:

```yaml
fields
  my_field:
    title: My title
    type: logic
```

### Code

In `config.php` put this code:

```php
<?php
kirby()->hook('pluginLogicField', function($field, $page) { ?>
	<strong>Title:</strong><?php echo $page->title(); ?><br>
	<strong>Field name:</strong><?php echo $field->name(); ?>
<?php }); ?>
```

If you don't like inline html you can replace it with a snippet.

You can also use the code inside of a plugin. In that case you need to put this code before the hook:

```php
kirby()->plugin('kirby-logic-field');
```
