*Version 1.0.0*

Inject your logic into a custom field.

**[- Installation instructions - ](docs/install.md)**

## Usage

### Blueprint

Set the `type` to `logic`:

```yaml
fields:
  my_logic_field:
    title: My logic field
    type: logic
```

### Code

In `config.php` put this code:

```php
kirby()->hook('pluginLogicField', function($field, $page) {
	echo $page->title();
	echo $field->name();
});
```

## Advanced (optional alternatives)

### Code with snippet

If you don't like inline html you can replace it with a [snippet](https://getkirby.com/docs/templates/snippets).

```php
kirby()->hook('pluginLogicField', function($field, $page) {
	snippet('some-logic', ['field' => $field, 'page' => $page]);
});
```

### As plugin

You can also use the code inside of a plugin. Then you need to force load the plugin first:

```php
kirby()->plugin('kirby-logic-field');

// Hook code goes here
```
